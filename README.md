# MOD(Moving Object Detector)
MOD is a Python program that can detect objects that are moving.
## How it Works 
The initial frame is captured and the upcoming frames are compared to the initial one. If any object is moved from its initial location, it will be detected. New objects entering the frame will be detected as well.
